## 2026-03-17 — Double input bug in production Tauri builds (RESOLVED)

**Status: fixed**

First keystroke after each prompt appeared doubled in production builds (`tauri build`), but worked perfectly in dev mode (`tauri dev`). Same bug existed in the earlier Electrobun version. Typing "echo hi" rendered as "ececho hi".

**Root cause:** Missing locale environment + non-login shell. When a macOS app launches from `/Applications` (via Finder/launchd), it gets a barebones environment — no `LANG`, no `LC_ALL`. In dev mode, `tauri dev` inherits the full terminal environment, so everything works. Without `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`, zsh's ZLE and plugins (autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, Starship) miscalculate character widths on the first keystroke, position the cursor wrong, and the first character renders with ghost artifacts.

**Fix (pty.rs):**
```rust
Command::new(shell_path)
    .arg("-l")  // login shell — sources ~/.zprofile, /etc/zprofile
    .env("LANG", "en_US.UTF-8")
    .env("LC_ALL", "en_US.UTF-8")
```

**What we ruled out first (all dead ends):**
- Custom native menu / `Menu::default` — no effect
- Menu event listener in JS — no effect
- Ghost processes — none found
- Doubled IPC calls — debug logs showed input fires once, output seq numbers are clean
- xterm.js `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` workaround intercepting all printable chars — no effect
- Recent code regression — bug existed in older commits too (`b190e64`, `c761d23`)

**Lesson:** When spawning PTY shells from a GUI app on macOS, ALWAYS set locale env vars and spawn as a login shell. The launchd environment is not the same as a terminal environment. This applies to any framework (Tauri, Electrobun, Electron).

## 2026-03-17 — Implement ~/.plexi directory: workspace persistence + config file

Added filesystem persistence for workspaces and a global config file. Structure:

```
~/.plexi/
  config.json          # global settings (terminal, shell, keyboard)
  workspaces/
    default.json       # workspace layout + contexts + panel metadata
    <name>.json        # future: multiple named workspaces
```

**Key decisions:**

1. **Workspaces are named files, not a single workspace.json.** Each workspace is `~/.plexi/workspaces/<name>.json`. Currently only "default" is used, but the API supports multiple named workspaces for future workspace switching.

2. **Config overrides in workspace files.** Workspace documents already serialize `terminal` and `keyboard` keys. These can override the global config via `resolveConfig()` in `plexi-config.js`. No new format needed.

3. **Config file written on first launch.** If `~/.plexi/config.json` doesn't exist, defaults are written from `plexi-config.js`. Values come from the existing hardcoded constants in `app-constants.js`. Comments in the code note which settings aren't actually wired up yet (theme, fonts, keybinds).

4. **localStorage kept as fallback.** Every save still writes to localStorage in addition to disk. This means the app degrades gracefully if the disk write fails.

5. **Skipped "profiles" concept.** Profiles would bundle config + workspace together — unnecessary complexity until users ask for it.

6. **Rust side uses `dirs` crate** for `home_dir()`. Workspace names are sanitized to prevent path traversal.

**New files:** `src-tauri/src/config.rs`, `src/mainview/plexi-config.js`
**Modified:** `lib.rs` (6 new commands), `tauri-session-bridge.js` (bridge stubs → real IPC), `workspace-storage.js` (tauri mode support), `app.js` (config loading + mode checks)

## 2026-03-17 — Future enhancement: scriptable workspace layouts
Like tmuxinator/tmuxp — user-defined named layouts that open split panes with specific commands pre-launched (e.g. "dev stack" = frontend + backend side-by-side). First-class differentiator for Plexi. Not MVP — shelved until there are users.

## 2026-03-17 — Real PTY sessions fixed on macOS Tauri

**Status: resolved**

The actual root cause of `[session failed] undefined` was not the frontend retry loop. It was the PTY backend.

- `pty-process 0.4` was being used with the older borrowed-PTS spawn API. On macOS this fails during controlling-terminal setup with `Inappropriate ioctl for device (os error 25)`, so `open_session` rejected before the shell ever started.
- The frontend then rendered `error.message`, but Tauri invoke errors can arrive as plain strings/objects, so the user-facing result became `undefined` instead of the real backend error.

**Fixes applied:**

1. Upgraded `pty-process` from `0.4` to `0.5.3`.
2. Switched PTY creation to `blocking::open()` and moved the slave PTY into `Command::spawn(...)` using the current API, which works on macOS.
3. `spawn_shell()` now returns the resolved working directory so the frontend gets a real `cwd` immediately.
4. Tauri bridge errors are normalized to real `Error` objects before surfacing to the UI.
5. Added a Rust session test that opens a real shell, sends `printf '__PLEXI_OK__\n'`, and verifies the output round-trip.
6. Native `npm run dev` smoke check now shows successful session creation in logs:
   - `Spawned shell: /bin/zsh (80x24)`
   - `Opened session panel-1 with shell zsh (80x24)`

**Additional Tauri architecture issue found:**

- `beforeDevCommand` used `npx serve src -l 1415`, and if port `1415` was busy it silently picked a random port while Tauri still loaded `http://localhost:1415/mainview/`. That creates stale-frontend debugging traps. Replaced it with `python3 -m http.server 1415 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory src` so port conflicts fail loudly instead of drifting.

## 2026-03-17 — Real PTY sessions not opening: current blocker

**Status: unresolved — handing off**

The Tauri IPC bridge is now wired up and `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` is detected correctly, so the app is no longer falling back to the mock shell. However, real zsh sessions are still not starting successfully. Symptoms:

- UI shows `[session failed] <error>` in the terminal panel
- `poll_session_output` floods the console with "Session not found" (hundreds of times before stopping)

**What was fixed in this session:**

1. **`window.__TAURI__` not injected**: `withGlobalTauri: true` added to `tauri.conf.json` under `app`. Without it, `window.__TAURI__` is undefined and the bridge falls back to mock every time.

2. **Wrong detection check**: `hasTauriRuntime()` was checking `window.__TAURI__.invoke` (Tauri 1.x location) but Tauri 2.x puts it at `window.__TAURI__.core.invoke`. Fixed to use `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` for detection (always injected by Tauri regardless of `withGlobalTauri`) and `getInvoke()` helper that tries `__TAURI__.core.invoke` then falls back to `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke`.

3. **PTY spawn with bad CWD**: Workspace restored from localStorage had `cwd: "/mock/project"` (from old mock sessions). `pty.spawn_shell()` with a non-existent CWD fails. Fixed in `pty.rs` to silently fall back to `$HOME` if the saved CWD path doesn't exist.

4. **Infinite retry loop on session failure**: `ensurePanelSession` was called on every `render()`. When `openSession` threw, it called `panelSessions.delete(panel.id)`, which allowed the next render to retry immediately — infinite loop. Also called `render()` from inside the catch block, making it worse. Fixed by adding a `panelSessionFailed` Set; failed sessions are not retried until explicitly closed.

5. **Polling loop on session not found**: `_startPolling` caught errors with `console.error` but never stopped the interval. 1000+ "Session not found" errors per run. Fixed: stop polling after 3 consecutive errors.

6. **`just dev-fresh`**: Added `justfile` with `dev` and `dev-fresh` recipes. `dev-fresh` uses `tauri dev --config` to override `devUrl` to `src/fresh.html`, which clears `localStorage["plexi.workspace.v2"]` before redirecting to `/mainview/`. Eliminates stale mock-era workspace state on startup.

**Current state / what the next agent should investigate:**

After all the above fixes, `just dev-fresh` + `Cmd+N` still shows `[session failed]` and "Session not found" errors (though now only ~13 instead of 1000+). The root cause is not yet confirmed. Key things to check:

- **What is the actual error message from `open_session`?** Add `console.error("openSession failed:", error)` to the catch block in `ensurePanelSession` in `app.js` and check DevTools console. The error string from Rust will say whether it's "Failed to spawn PTY: ..." or "Session already exists" or something else.
- **Is `open_session` even being called?** Add a `console.log` before the `invoke("open_session", ...)` call in `tauri-session-bridge.js` to confirm IPC is reaching Rust.
- **Is the Tauri app being fully rebuilt?** Changes to `pty.rs` require a full Rust rebuild. `npm run dev` triggers this, but `just dev` may not if the Tauri watcher doesn't detect the change. Confirm with `cargo build` directly.
- **Check Tauri logs**: Run `RUST_LOG=debug npm run dev` or look at `~/Library/Logs/dev.plexi/` for PTY spawn errors.
- **The remaining 13 "Session not found" errors**: These come AFTER the polling stop-on-3-errors fix. 13 / 3 = ~4 separate polling intervals were started, meaning `open_session` succeeded for ~4 sessions before they disappeared. This suggests sessions ARE being opened (Rust side OK) but then something calls `close_session` or removes them. Possible culprit: `syncVisiblePaneRuntimes` disposes runtimes on re-render, but does NOT call `closePanelSession` — check whether `disposePaneRuntime` is inadvertently triggering session cleanup.

## 2026-03-17 — Fix Tauri app initialization and IPC bridge

Multiple issues prevented the Tauri rebuild from being functional:

1. **Electrobun bare import crash**: `session-bridge.js` had `import { Electroview } from "electrobun/view"` — a bare specifier that crashes in any non-Electrobun environment (Tauri, browser). `app.js` imported both bridges unconditionally, so this killed the entire module graph. Fix: removed Electrobun bridge import from `app.js`; `tauri-session-bridge.js` now falls back to mock bridge directly.

2. **Double log plugin registration**: `lib.rs` had `.plugin(tauri_plugin_log::...)` on the builder AND again inside `.setup()`. Also had two `.setup()` blocks. Consolidated to one empty `.setup()`.

3. **IPC parameter naming**: Tauri 2.x auto-converts camelCase JS args → snake_case Rust params. Original bridge used `panel_id` (snake_case) in JS which wouldn't match. Fixed all IPC calls to use camelCase (`panelId`, `lastSeq`, etc.).

4. **Blocking PTY reads under mutex**: `poll_session_output` locked the SessionManager mutex then did a blocking `read()` on the PTY fd. If no data, this blocked all other IPC commands. Fix: set PTY fd to `O_NONBLOCK` via `libc::fcntl` after spawn.

5. **Polling never started after openSession**: `openSession()` fired `onStarted` but never called `_startPolling()`. Terminal output never arrived. Fix: start polling immediately after successful open.

6. **Dev server for Playwright**: Added `beforeDevCommand` with `npx serve src` to `tauri.conf.json` so Tauri dev mode serves frontend over HTTP. Playwright tests now point to `/mainview/` path. All 10 e2e tests pass.

## 2026-03-15 — Fix 14px black gap on right side of xterm terminal

xterm's FitAddon (v6) subtracts a scrollbar width when `scrollback > 0`: `overviewRuler?.width || 14`. With no `overviewRuler` option set, it always subtracts 14px, leaving a black gap where the canvas doesn't reach the terminal frame edge.

Fix: set `overviewRuler: { width: 1 }` in Terminal options so FitAddon subtracts 1px instead of 14px. Then hide the resulting 1px ruler canvas (`.xterm-decoration-overview-ruler`) and the native scrollbar element (`.scrollbar.vertical`) with CSS `display: none / width: 0`. Also suppress the native viewport scrollbar with `scrollbar-width: none`.

Setting `overviewRuler: { width: 0 }` doesn't work because `0 || 14 = 14` — needs a truthy value to bypass the fallback.

## 2026-03-14 — Remove overview mode entirely

Deleted the overview feature: `#overview-shell` HTML, all `.overview-*` CSS, `mode`/`camera` state, `toggleMode`/`panCamera`/`adjustZoom`/`resetViewport` from workspace-state.js, `toggleOverview`/`zoomIn`/`zoomOut` commands, all keyboard handlers, and `renderOverview`/`renderOverviewHud` functions.

Why: Overview was decorative at this stage — no dragging, no meaningful spatial navigation beyond what the minimap already provides. The mode boundary was leaky (zoom changed terminal font size even in overview mode). An empty overview state duplicated the empty landing screen. Cut it until there's a real use case.

Also fixed two pre-existing gaps exposed by the test suite: `#focus-title` was showing directory name instead of panel title, and context rename was using a custom modal instead of `window.prompt()`. Simplified rename to native prompt. Added `#toolbar-context` and `#focus-position` to the toolbar (were already tested, just missing from HTML).
